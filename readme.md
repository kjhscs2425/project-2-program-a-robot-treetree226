Project Requirements:
* [ ] robot moves
* [ ] robot does not crash into the walls of the box
* [ ] at least 5 calls to input
* [ ] at least 5 functions
* [ ] at least 2 functions have at least one parameter
* THIS ONE [ ] at least 2 functions have return values and at least one call to the function is assigned to a variable
* [ ] each motor moves at least once
* THIS ONE [ ] the robot's movement changes based on at least 5 readings of the sonar sensors**** Wait for new code update to implement this part!!
* [ ] use at least 1 while loop OR recursive function call
* THIS ONE [ ] at least one command (user input) causes the robot to move autonomously for at least 20 seconds

Dr. EB Todo:
